	<p>James is a fourth year computer engineering undergraduate student at the University of California, San Diego with an interest in web development,
	   embedded systems, HCI (recently), and 3D computer graphics.</p>

	   <p> Below is an in progress 3D threejs scene </p>

			var camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera( 75, window.innerWidth/window.innerHeight, 0.1, 1000 );

			var renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();
			renderer.setSize( window.innerWidth/2, window.innerHeight/2 );
			document.body.appendChild( renderer.domElement );

			var geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry( 1, 1, 1 );
			var material = new THREE.MeshLambertMaterial( { color: 0x00ff00, shininess: 30, shading: THREE.flatShading, specular: 0xFFFFFF} );
			var cube = new THREE.Mesh( geometry, material );
			var light = new THREE.AmbientLight( 0x303030 ); // soft white light
			var directionalLight = new THREE.DirectionalLight( 0xffffff, 1 );

			directionalLight.position.set( 0, 1, 1 );
			scene.add( directionalLight );
			scene.add( light );
			scene.add( cube );

			camera.position.z = 5;

			var render = function () {

				cube.rotation.x += 0.01;
				cube.rotation.y += 0.01;

				renderer.render(scene, camera);

		<li><a href="http://cogs121-piedpiper.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">Average Housing Price Finder for the San Diego Area</a></li>
		<p> This was my group's final project for cogs 121. It is a website that shows users the average housing price 
		    per neighborhood in San Diego. <p>

		<li><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/mithrilsmartshirt/home" target="_blank">Smart Shirt</a></li>
		<p> This was my group's project for CSE 145: Embedded Systems. We created a smart shirt that would obtain biometric data on the wearer and send
			the data to their mobile device. The data would be used by the wearer to track their performance relative to their fiteness goals. </p>
